1st check-in: Developing a model/outline of how the UI will be structured (component hierarchies, deciding how to use state + props, etc.). Write in a .txt file and submit for review~




Components & Props:


Start (OPTIONAL, leaving out for now)
* Props: handleStart method
* Waits for text input for player names, then enables submit button which fires handleStart()


Game
* Renders 9 squares 
* Props: click event handler (propagated to children squares), board array


Square 
* Props: board position/index, value [x/o], click event handler, running total (player 1 wins - player 2 wins)
* When square is clicked, square index passed into handleClick(index)


* End
* Props: handleEnd() method, winner name, playAgain() method, restart() method
* handleEnd(): displays winning player’s name, called after 3 in a row
* playAgain(): calls Game and Square but persists tally of wins
* restart(): calls Game and Square but restarts tally of wins (0-0)




Hooks:
* UseState
* Overall TikTakToe hook that tracks all controller-related data (status, current player etc)
